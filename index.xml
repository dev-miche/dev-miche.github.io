      <description>As per Wikipedia definition, Ctags is a programming tool that generates an index (or tag) file of names found in source and header files of various programming languages. Depending on the language, functions, variables, class members, macros and so on may be indexed. These tags allow definitions to be quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility.
In other words, Ctags indexes a projectâ€™s classes, methods, etc in a file called tag.</description>

      <description>.gitignore is the git config file where we can declare files and folder to exclude from git commits, such as log files, build files and system generated files. There is a set of certain files which we may need to exclude from the every project and it is a tedious task to add those files in .gitignore manually for each project. To avoid this we can create a global .gitignore file.</description>
