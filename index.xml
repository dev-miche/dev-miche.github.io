      <description>.gitignore is the git config file where we can declare files and folder to exclude from git commits, such as log files, build files and system generated files. There is a set of certain files which we may need to exclude from the every project and it is a tedious task to add those files in .gitignore manually for each project. To avoid this we can create a global .gitignore file.</description>
